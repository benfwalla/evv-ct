## All Exceptions

| Code | Type | Name | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| **0** | Fix | Unknown Client | Visit performed for client not in EVV system |

| **23** | Fix | Missing Service | Service provided during visit not recorded |

## Fix-Required Exceptions

### Exception 0: Unknown Client

**Cause**: Visit submitted for client that doesn't exist in system

**Solution**:
1. Create client record first
2. Wait for client to be accepted
3. Resubmit visit

```json
// Error Response
{
  "ErrorCode": "0",
  "ErrorMessage": "Unknown Client. Client must exist before submitting visit."
}

// Solution: Create client first
POST /clients/rest/api/v1.1
[{
  "ClientIdentifier": "987654321",
  "ClientFirstName": "John",
  "ClientLastName": "Doe",
  ...
}]

// Then submit visit
POST /visits/rest/api/v1.1
[{
  "ClientIdentifier": "987654321",
  ...
}]
```

### Exception 1: Unknown Employee

**Cause**: Visit submitted for employee that doesn't exist in system

**Solution**:
1. Create employee record first
2. Wait for employee to be accepted
3. Resubmit visit

```json
// Error Response
{
  "ErrorCode": "1",
  "ErrorMessage": "Unknown Employee. Worker not found in system."
}

// Solution: Create employee first
POST /employees/rest/api/v1.1
[{
  "EmployeeIdentifier": "000012345",
  "EmployeeFirstName": "Jane",
  "EmployeeLastName": "Smith",
  ...
}]

// Then submit visit
POST /visits/rest/api/v1.1
[{
  "EmployeeIdentifier": "000012345",
  ...
}]
```

### Exception 3: Visits Without In-Calls

**Cause**: Visit doesn't have a "Time In" call

**Solution**: Add Calls segment with Time In call

```json
// Error Response
{
  "ErrorCode": "3",
  "ErrorMessage": "Visit Without In-Call. All visits require Time In call."
}

// Solution: Add Time In call
{
  "Calls": [{
    "CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
    "CallAssignment": "Time In",
    "CallType": "Mobile",
    ...
  }, {
    "CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z",
    "CallAssignment": "Time Out",
    "CallType": "Mobile",
    ...
  }]
}
```

### Exception 4: Visits Without Out-Calls

**Cause**: Visit doesn't have a "Time Out" call

**Solution**: Add Calls segment with Time Out call

```json
// Error Response
{
  "ErrorCode": "4",
  "ErrorMessage": "Visit Without Out-Call. All visits require Time Out call."
}

// Solution: Add Time Out call
{
  "Calls": [{
    "CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
    "CallAssignment": "Time In",
    "CallType": "Mobile",
    ...
  }, {
    "CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z",
    "CallAssignment": "Time Out",
    "CallType": "Mobile",
    ...
  }]
}
```

### Exception 23: Missing Service

**Cause**: Visit doesn't have a valid procedure code

**Solution**: Add valid ProcedureCode for the payer/program

```json
// Error Response
{
  "ErrorCode": "23",
  "ErrorMessage": "Missing Service. Valid procedure code required."
}

// Solution: Add valid procedure code
{
  "PayerID": "CTHH",
  "PayerProgram": "HHI",
  "ProcedureCode": "T1004",
  "Modifier1": "NULL",
  ...
}
```

## Acknowledgeable Exceptions

### Exception 15: Unmatched Client ID / Phone

**Cause**: Visit recorded from phone number not matched to client (Telephony only)

**Solution**: Acknowledge the exception

```json
{
  "VisitExceptionAcknowledgement": [{
    "ExceptionID": "15",
    "ExceptionAcknowledged": "true"
  }]
}
```

**When to Use**:
- Telephony visits where phone number verification failed
- Client called from different phone than registered
- Emergency situations requiring immediate care

**Requirements**:
- Must attest that exception has been reviewed
- Must confirm appropriate documentation exists
- Must acknowledge in system

## Exception Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit Visit">
    POST visit data to API
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Response">
    Check for exceptions in status response
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identify Exception Type">
    Determine if exception requires fix or acknowledgement
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take Action">
    **Fix Required**: Correct data and resubmit
    
    **Acknowledgeable**: Add VisitExceptionAcknowledgement segment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resubmit">
    Increment SequenceID and resubmit visit
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage in API

### Acknowledging Exception

```json
{
  "VisitOtherID": "VISIT001",
  "SequenceID": 2,
  ...
  "VisitExceptionAcknowledgement": [{
    "ExceptionID": "15",
    "ExceptionAcknowledged": "true"
  }]
}
```

### Multiple Exceptions

```json
{
  "VisitExceptionAcknowledgement": [
    {
      "ExceptionID": "15",
      "ExceptionAcknowledged": "true"
    },
    {
      "ExceptionID": "23",
      "ExceptionAcknowledged": "false"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Rules

<Warning>
  **Important Rules**
</Warning>

### Fix-Required Exceptions
- Cannot be acknowledged
- Must fix underlying issue
- Resubmit with corrected data
- Increment SequenceID

### Acknowledgeable Exceptions
- Can be acknowledged with VisitExceptionAcknowledgement segment
- Requires attestation
- Documentation must exist
- ExceptionAcknowledged must be "true"

### Exception ID Format
- Must be string, not integer
- Use exact values from table
- Case sensitive

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Cannot acknowledge | Trying to acknowledge fix-required exception | Fix data and resubmit |
| Invalid ExceptionID | ExceptionID not in list | Use valid exception code |
| Missing acknowledgement | Exception 15 not acknowledged | Add VisitExceptionAcknowledgement |
| Wrong format | ExceptionID as integer | Use string format ("15" not 15) |

## Best Practices
