## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose Specific Codes">
    Use the most specific reason code available rather than defaulting to "22 - Other"
    
    ✅ Good: Use "12 - Staff Late" for late arrivals
    
    ❌ Avoid: Using "22 - Other" when a specific code exists
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Clear Memos">
    When memos are required or optional, provide clear, concise explanations
    
    ✅ Good: "Employee checked in 10 minutes late due to traffic accident on Route 84"
    
    ❌ Avoid: "late" or vague descriptions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Track Changes">
    Maintain your own audit log of changes in addition to the VisitChanges segment
    
    - Store original values
    - Track who approved changes
    - Document business justification
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consistent Usage">
    Establish organizational standards for which codes to use in which situations
    
    - Document internal policies
