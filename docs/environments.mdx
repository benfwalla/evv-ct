## Available Environments

The CT EVV API provides two environments for development and production use.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="UAT (Testing)" icon="flask">
    For development, testing, and user acceptance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production" icon="rocket">
    For live data submission
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## UAT Environment

Use the UAT environment for:
- Initial integration development
- Testing new features
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Training and demonstrations

### UAT Endpoints

<CodeGroup>

```bash Clients
https://uat-api.sandata.com/interfaces/intake/clients/rest/api/v1.1
```

```bash Employees
https://uat-api.sandata.com/interfaces/intake/employees/rest/api/v1.1
```

```bash Visits
https://uat-api.sandata.com/interfaces/intake/visits/rest/api/v1.1
```

</CodeGroup>

### UAT WADL Documentation

Access API documentation at:

```

https://uat-api.sandata.com/interfaces/intake/visits/rest/api/v1.1/wadl
```

## Production Environment

Use the Production environment for:
- Live visit data submission
- Real client and employee management
- Actual billing and claims processing

<Warning>
  Production data affects real billing and claims. Ensure thorough testing in UAT before moving to Production.
</Warning>

### Production Endpoints

<CodeGroup>

```bash Clients

```

</CodeGroup>

### Production WADL Documentation

Access API documentation at:

```

## Environment Differences

| Feature | UAT | Production |
|---------|-----|------------|
| **Purpose** | Testing & Development | Live Operations |
| **Data** | Test/Sample Data | Real Client Data |
| **Credentials** | Separate UAT credentials | Separate Production credentials |
| **Billing Impact** | No | Yes |
| **Uptime SLA** | Best effort | 99.9% |
| **Support Hours** | Business hours | 24/7 for critical issues |

## Migration Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete UAT Testing">
    - Test all three endpoints (Client, Employee, Visit)
    - Validate business rules and error handling
    - Perform end-to-end workflow testing
    - Document any issues or questions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request Production Access">
    Contact your Sandata implementation manager to:
    - Schedule production cutover
    - Receive production credentials
    - Review go-live checklist
  </Step>

  <Step title="Production Deployment">
    - Update configuration with production URLs
    - Update credentials
    - Perform smoke tests
    - Monitor initial submissions closely
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ongoing Monitoring">
    - Monitor error rates
    - Track processing times
    - Review rejection reports
    - Maintain regular communication with Sandata
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limits & Performance

### Transaction Limits

Both environments enforce the same limits:

<ParamField body="records_per_transaction" type="number" default="1-5000">
  Each POST request can contain 1 to 5,000 records
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="processing_time" type="string" default="varies">
  Processing time varies based on:
  - Number of records in transaction
  - System load
  - Complexity of validation rules
  
  Typical processing: 30 seconds to 5 minutes
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="status_check_interval" type="string" default="5 minutes">
  Wait at least 5 minutes before checking status
</ParamField>

### Peak Load Handling

During peak loads:
- Records may be queued for processing
- Status checks may return "not ready yet"
- Expected behavior: Wait and retry status check

<Info>
  If you receive "The result for the input UUID is not ready yet", wait 5 minutes and check again.
</Info>

## VPN Requirements

<Warning>
  **Critical**: All API requests must originate from within the USA.
</Warning>

Both UAT and Production environments require:
- Requests from US-based servers, OR
- Requests through a US-based VPN

International requests will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Separation">
    - Maintain separate configurations for UAT and Production
    - Never use production credentials in UAT
    - Use environment variables for URLs and credentials
    - Implement clear visual indicators of which environment is active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Testing Strategy">
    - Test all scenarios in UAT first
    - Use realistic test data volumes
    - Test error handling and edge cases
    - Perform load testing in UAT
    - Document test results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitoring">
    - Log all API requests and responses (without credentials)
    - Monitor success/failure rates
    - Track processing times
    - Set up alerts for unusual patterns
    - Review logs regularly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment">
    - Use blue-green or canary deployment strategies
    - Have rollback procedures ready
    - Monitor closely after deployment
    - Keep UAT environment synchronized with production code
  </Accordion>
