## What is a Visit?

A **Visit** represents an Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) event where an employee provides services to a client. Visits capture the who, what, when, and where of service delivery, including:

- Time in/out (via calls or manual entry)
- Services provided (procedure codes)
- Tasks performed
- Location verification (GPS or telephony)
- Changes and adjustments
- Exception acknowledgements

## Visit Endpoint Purpose

The Visit endpoint allows you to:
- Submit new visit records
- Update existing visits
- Record call times (check-in/check-out)
- Document adjusted times
- Track tasks performed
- Log visit changes and reasons
- Acknowledge exceptions
- Manage visit status (billable/omit)

## Key Concepts

### Visit Components

A visit consists of multiple segments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visit General" icon="info-circle">
    Core visit information (33 fields)
    Employee, Client, Payer, Program, Times
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calls" icon="phone">
    Check-in/check-out events (14 fields)
    Mobile, Telephony, FVV, or Manual
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visit Changes" icon="pen-to-square">
    Change log and reason codes (7 fields)
    Required for adjustments and updates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tasks" icon="list-check">
    Services performed (3 fields per task)
    Required for certain programs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Prerequisites

<Warning>
  **Critical**: Before submitting visits, you must have:
</Warning>

- ✅ Created the employee referenced in the visit
- ✅ Created the client referenced in the visit
- ✅ Both employee and client must exist in the same provider account

If either is missing, the visit will be rejected.

### Visit Timing

Visits can be captured in different ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mobile (GPS)">
    Employee uses mobile app with GPS
    - Captures latitude/longitude
    - Requires MobileLogin
    - Most accurate location verification
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Telephony">
    Employee calls in/out via phone
    - Captures phone number
    - Requires TelephonyPIN
    - Location based on phone number
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="FVV (Fixed)">
    Fixed Visit Verification device
    - In-home device
    - No GPS coordinates
    - Location is client address
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual">
    Manually entered times
    - No device verification
    - Requires VisitChanges segment
    - Must include reason code
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data Structure

}
```

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Prerequisites">
    Ensure employee and client exist in the system
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Capture Visit Data">
    Collect all visit information including times, location, and tasks
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Visit">
    POST visit data with SequenceID = 1
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive UUID">
    API returns UUID for tracking
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Wait 5 minutes, then GET status
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Handle Results">
    Process success or fix errors and resubmit
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Visit (GPS)">
    Employee uses mobile app:
    1. Employee checks in via mobile app (GPS captured)
    2. Performs services and tasks
    3. Employee checks out via mobile app (GPS captured)
    4. System submits visit with both calls
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Late Check-In/Early Check-Out">
    Employee forgets to check in on time:
    1. Employee checks in late (9:10 AM instead of 9:00 AM)
    2. Supervisor adjusts times to actual (9:00 AM - 1:00 PM)
    3. Submit visit with both Call times AND Adjusted times
    4. Include VisitChanges segment with reason code
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Manual Entry">
    Visit entered manually after the fact:
    1. No device calls available
    2. Enter actual visit times
    3. Set CallType = "Manual"
    4. Include VisitChanges segment with reason code
    5. Provide detailed memo
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Visit Correction">
    Need to update a previously submitted visit:
    1. Retrieve original visit data
    2. Make necessary changes
    3. Increment SequenceID
    4. Include VisitChanges segment
    5. Resubmit complete visit
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Visit Cancellation">
    Need to cancel a visit:
    - **If no calls**: Set VisitCancelledIndicator = true
    - **If calls exist**: Set BillVisit = false (cannot cancel)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Critical Business Rules

<Warning>
  **Time Validation Rules**
</Warning>

### Call Times Only
- CallOut must be > CallIn
- Both calls required for first submission

### Adjusted Times Only
- AdjOut must be > AdjIn

### Both Call and Adjusted Times
- AdjOut must be > AdjIn
- AdjOut must be > CallIn
- CallOut must be > AdjIn

### Invalid Scenarios

❌ **Calls BEFORE visit** (will be rejected):
```json
{
  "AdjInDateTime": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  "AdjOutDateTime": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z",
  "Calls": [
    {"CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T08:30:00Z", "CallAssignment": "Time In"},
    {"CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T08:45:00Z", "CallAssignment": "Time Out"}
  ]
}
```

❌ **Calls AFTER visit** (will be rejected):
```json
{
  "AdjInDateTime": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  "AdjOutDateTime": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z",
  "Calls": [
    {"CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T13:30:00Z", "CallAssignment": "Time In"},
    {"CallDateTime": "2024-01-15T13:45:00Z", "CallAssignment": "Time Out"}
  ]
}
```

## Conditional Requirements

### When VisitChanges is REQUIRED

- CallType = "Manual"
- AdjInDateTime is provided
- AdjOutDateTime is provided
- Any visit update (SequenceID > 1)
- Tasks are updated

### When Tasks are REQUIRED

Tasks must be provided for these programs:
- **ABP** - Acquired Brain Injury Non-Clinical
- **AUP** - Autism Professional
- **CHP** - CT Home Care Program
- **PCP** - Personal Care Assistant
- **MHP** - Mental Health Program

### Call Type Requirements

| Call Type | Required Fields |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Mobile** | CallLatitude, CallLongitude, MobileLogin |
| **Telephony** | TelephonyPIN, OriginatingPhoneNumber |
| **FVV** | None (basic fields only) |
| **Manual** | VisitChanges segment |

## Field Count

The Visit endpoint is the most complex:

- **Visit General**: 33 fields
- **Calls**: 14 fields per call (up to 2 calls)
- **Visit Changes**: 7 fields
- **Tasks**: 3 fields per task (repeatable)
- **Exception Acknowledgement**: 2 fields per exception
- **Total**: 50+ fields

## Performance Considerations

<Info>
  **Best Practices for Visit Submissions**
</Info>

- **Batch Size**: 1-5,000 visits per transaction
- **Frequency**: Submit in near real-time (within 24 hours)
- **Dependencies**: Ensure employees and clients exist first
- **Processing Time**: 30 seconds to 5 minutes
- **Status Check**: Wait 5 minutes before checking
