<Steps>

  <Step title="Warm-Up Discussion: What Is a Paystub?">
    Start the group with casual conversation. Ask:
    • Has anyone ever received a paycheck?  
    • Have you ever seen a paystub from a job your parent or guardian had?  
    • What questions do you have about how people get paid?  
    The goal is to surface prior knowledge and get everyone talking. Keep it light and encouraging.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Introduce the Concept Using a Simple Explanation">
    Show this Easy Peasy Finance page:  
    **https://www.easypeasyfinance.com/paycheck-pay-stub-for-kids-beginners/**  
    Explain that this is a friendly, easy way to learn the basics.  
    I like using this resource because the definitions are short, the drawings are simple, and it sets a non-intimidating tone before showing them a real paystub.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch a Visual Example Together">
    Play this YouTube video:  
    **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU1MOqaU1Q8**  
    Pause a few times to check understanding.  
    Ask:  
    • Which number shows the money you earned before deductions?  
    • Which one shows the money you actually take home?  
    • What deductions did you see in the example?  
    The goal is to strengthen comprehension through repetition and visuals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Show a Realistic Sample Paystub (From Your Kibu Video)">
    Pull up the paystub shown in your Kibu class video.  
    Have learners point to:  
    • Gross pay  
    • Net pay  
    • Deductions  
    • Pay period  
    • YTD amounts  
    Let them take turns identifying one part at a time.  
    Encourage them to explain in their own words what each section means.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Guided Practice With a Worksheet">
    Hand out a printed worksheet with a simple fictional paystub.  
    Tasks:  
    • Circle gross pay in blue  
    • Circle net pay in green  
    • Underline one deduction  
    • Write one sentence: “My take-home pay is the money I actually get.”  
    This step makes the learning concrete and allows DSPs to support participants one-on-one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Group Activity: Your First Paycheck Role-Play">
    Have everyone pretend they just worked at a grocery store for their first week.  
    Give each learner a pretend paycheck envelope and paystub.  
    Ask:  
    • How many hours did you work?  
    • What was your pay rate?  
    • What is your take-home pay?  
    This builds confidence and provides social, hands-on engagement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quick Knowledge Check (Google Form)">
    Share a simple quiz (example placeholder link):  
    **https://forms.gle/kibu-paystub-quiz**  
    The quiz might include:  
    • True/false: Net pay is the money you take home.  
    • Multiple-choice: What does YTD mean?  
    • Identify: Which number on this sample represents gross pay?  
    Use this as a light assessment tool for DSPs to gauge understanding.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap-Up and Reflection">
    Ask learners:  
    • What new thing did you learn today?  
    • What part of a paystub still seems confusing?  
    • Why is it important to understand where your money goes?  
    End by reinforcing the key idea: a paystub helps you understand your earnings and deductions so you can manage your money confidently.
