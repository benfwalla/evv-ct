<Steps>

  <Step title="Warm-Up Discussion: What Is a Paystub?">
    Begin with light conversation to activate prior knowledge. Ask:
    • Have you ever seen a paycheck?  
    • Has someone in your family shown you their paystub before?  
    • What do you think a paystub is for?  

    The goal is engagement, comfort, and building curiosity before showing anything technical.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Introduce the Concept with a Simple Explanation">
    Use this Easy Peasy Finance explanation to introduce the idea of a paystub in friendly language:

    </Frame>

    I like starting here because the visuals are simple, non-intimidating, and the definitions are short enough for all learners to follow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch a Visual Example Together">
    Next, watch this YouTube explanation of a paystub:

        allowFullScreen
      ></iframe>
    </Frame>

    Pause occasionally to ask:
    • What is gross pay?  
    • What is net pay?  
    • What deductions did you notice?  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Show a Realistic Sample Paystub and Walk Through It">
    Display the sample paystub used in your Kibu video or a worksheet version.  
    Then guide learners through:
    • Gross pay  
    • Net pay  
    • Deductions (federal tax, state tax, FICA, etc.)  
    • Pay period  
    • YTD totals  

    This step helps bridge the cartoon-style explanation to a real-world example.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Guided Practice with Worksheet PDF">
    Use a printable worksheet for hands-on identification. This lets learners circle, label, and practice reading a paystub.

    <Frame>
      <iframe
        className="w-full h-96 rounded-xl"
        src="https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/167/paycheck-Putting-Your-Paycheck-to-Work-student-activities.pdf"
        title="Paycheck Worksheet PDF"
      ></iframe>
    </Frame>

    Instructions you can give:
    • Circle gross pay in blue  
    • Circle net pay in green  
    • Underline one deduction  
    • Highlight the pay period  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Group Role-Play: Your First Paycheck">
    Hand each learner a pretend paycheck envelope and paystub.  
    Then ask:
    • How many hours did you work?  
    • What was your hourly rate?  
    • How much did you actually take home?  

    The purpose is to make the concept more concrete and tactile.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Knowledge Check Quiz">
    Use a short Google Form to confirm comprehension and provide DSPs with insight into each learner’s progress, you can make a copy of this: https://forms.gle/example-kibu-paystub-quiz
    
    Example questions:
    • True or false: Net pay is the money you take home.  
    • What does YTD mean?  
    • Which number shows gross pay?  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap-Up and Reflection">
    End by asking:
    • What new thing did you learn today?  
    • What still feels confusing?  
    • Why is understanding your paystub important?  

    Reinforce the key lesson: A paystub shows where your money is going and helps you understand how you get paid.
