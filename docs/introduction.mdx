---

The Connecticut Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) Vendor API allows healthcare providers and EVV vendors to submit client, employee, and visit data to the Sandata Aggregator system in real-time.

This API supports the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) and Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) EVV programs.

This documentation is based on two official specification documents:

- **[CT EVV Vendor Specification v1.5](../../../CT-(DSS-DMHAS)_EVV_Vendor_Specification%20v1.5.pdf)** - Connecticut-specific EVV requirements
- **[EVV Vendor Specification v1.3](../../../EVV%20Vendor%20Spec%201.3.pdf)** - General Sandata EVV requirements for all states


## What is EVV?

Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) is a technology solution used to verify that home health and personal care visits occur. The 21st Century Cures Act requires states to implement EVV systems for Medicaid-funded personal care services and home health services.
